        <li>Meanwhile, prepare a gallon pitcher with the ice, and pour the lemon juice over the ice cubes.</li>

        <li>Pour the tea syrup over the prepared ice and lemon juice, and add water to the half-gallon mark, then stir with a long-handled spoon to mix well. Add the remainder of the water to make one gallon of lemon iced tea. Pour over ice in a tall glass, garnish with a slice of lemon if desired, and serve immediately, or refrigerate for up to three days (but it probably won't last that long!).</li>

        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <p> If you want to always make sure that you have iced tea on hand during the hot summer months, you can make the tea and sugar syrup ahead of time, store it in a mason jar, and have it handy and ready to mix up in a minute or two.</p>
